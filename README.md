# **Toolkit Collection**

A lightweight collection of assorted scripts, snippets, and utilities gathered over time.

Includes small helpers, test cases, macros, proof-of-concept code, and other experimental tools used for research, learning, and automation.

Nothing fancy — just a personal toolbox of things that might be useful later.
